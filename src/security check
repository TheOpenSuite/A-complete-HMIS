$query = "SELECT doc_dept FROM docs WHERE doc_id = ?";
$stmt = $mysqli->prepare($query);
$stmt->bind_param('i', $doc_id);
$stmt->execute();
$stmt->bind_result($doc_dept);
$stmt->fetch();
$stmt->close();

// Check if the department is "pharmacy"
if ($doc_dept == 'Pharmacy') {
    // Redirect to the login page
    header("Location: index.php");
    exit();
}

this to be added in every doctor file and changed in pharmacy to check if doc 

A similar thing should be added to the admin as well
